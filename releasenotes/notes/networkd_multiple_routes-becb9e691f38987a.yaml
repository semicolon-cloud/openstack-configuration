    Multiple routes can be supplied to the systemd network and they will be
    placed to a separate configuration file
    `/etc/systemd/network/{{ filename }}.d/routes.conf`

    Previously defining multiple routes will result in squashing them together
    under same section name, while for them to work properly each descriped
    route must be placed in it's own section.
