features:
  - |
    Added support for RabbitMQ quorum queues. Quorum queues are disabled
    by default. Followingvariables were implemented to control the behaviour:

      * oslomsg_rabbit_quorum_queues (default: false)
      * oslomsg_rabbit_quorum_delivery_limit (default: 0)
      * oslomsg_rabbit_quorum_max_memory_bytes (default: 0)

    Simmilar variables were also implemented for each service, while variables
    above aim to change behaviour globally.
upgrade:
  - |
    In case deployer wants to switch into using RabbitMQ quorum queues instead
    of traditional HA policies during OpenStack upgrade, they need to define
    variable ``oslomsg_rabbit_quorum_queues: True`` in user_variables.yml.

    If ``oslomsg_rabbit_quorum_queues`` is enabled,
    RabbitMQ vhosts will be re-created without leading ``/``. Ensure to
    reflect these changes in your monitoring software if vhosts are not
    auto-discovered.
    Also changing vhost name will result in prolonged downtime for services,
    as not re-configured yet backends will fail to connect to RabbitMQ until
    restart.
    It also might be worth to process upgrade with extra caution for some
    serivices that are sensetive to RabbitMQ downtime or even disabling usage
    of quorum queues for these services. Good examples of such services
    are Trove or Neutron with ML2 LXB or ML2 OVS drivers.
