    ``nova_ram_weight_multiplier`` was deprecated. Multipliers should be
    defined using ``nova_nova_conf_overrides``.
    Please note that default value for ``nova_ram_weight_multiplier`` was
    previously set to 5, while nova default is 1. This deprecation will
    slightly change weighing behavior in OSA.
