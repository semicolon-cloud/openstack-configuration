deprecations:
  - |
    In order to follow ansible naming conventions for variables,
    following variables were renamed:

      * systemd_TimeoutSec -> systemd_service_timeout_sec
      * systemd_Restart -> systemd_service_restart
      * systemd_RestartSec -> systemd_service_restart_sec
      * systemd_CPUAccounting -> systemd_service_cpu_accounting
      * systemd_BlockIOAccounting -> systemd_service_block_io_accounting
      * systemd_MemoryAccounting -> systemd_service_memory_accounting
      * systemd_TasksAccounting -> systemd_service_tasks_accounting
      * systemd_PrivateTmp -> systemd_service_private_tmp
      * systemd_PrivateDevices -> systemd_service_private_devices
      * systemd_PrivateNetwork -> systemd_service_private_network
      * systemd_PrivateUsers -> systemd_service_private_users

    Old variable names were kept for backwards compatibility but will be
    removed in next releases. It is highly adviced to use new variable
    names in your deployments.
