features:
  - |
    Added new keys ``haproxy_frontend_h2`` and ``haproxy_backend_h2``
    per service definition to enable HTTP/2 for a specified service.

    This also add new variables to control default behavoir for
    frontends and backends:

      * ``haproxy_frontend_h2: true``
      * ``haproxy_backend_h2: false``

    Please mention, that double stack of HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 is only available
    for TLS protected frontends. In case frontend is just TCP
    haproxy_frontend_h2 will be ignored.

    At the same time ``haproxy_backend_h2`` will be respected regardless of
    TLS/plain TCP configuration.
upgrade:
  - |
    HTTP/2 is enabled by default for frontends that are covered with TLS.
    You can disable this behaviour by setting ``haproxy_frontend_h2: false``
