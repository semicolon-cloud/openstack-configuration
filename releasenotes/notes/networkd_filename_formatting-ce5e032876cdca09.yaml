deprecations:
  - |
    Variables controlling systemd-networkd default filename templating when one
    is not supplied were deprecated and has no effect from now on.

      * systemd_networkd_filename
      * systemd_networkd_filename_alt

    It is highly recommended to provide ``filename`` parameter explicitly
    whenever you define ``systemd_netdevs`` or ``systemd_networks`` structures.
