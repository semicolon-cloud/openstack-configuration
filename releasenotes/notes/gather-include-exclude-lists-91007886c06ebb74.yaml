    It is now possible to use multiple variables with a specific prefix to
    define the whole contents of the tempest test include/exclude lists.
    Any variable from host/group or ansible extra-vars whose name is prefixed
    with the value in the os_tempest role default `tempest_test_search_includelist_pattern`
    or `tempest_test_search_excludelist_pattern` will be combined with the
    existing `tempest_test_includelist` or `tempest_test_excludelist` variables
    into a single include/exclude list.
